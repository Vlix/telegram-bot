-- MISCELLANEOUS REQUESTS --

data UpdatesRequest = UpdatesRequest
  { getUpdates_offset          :: Maybe Int -- ^ Identifier of the first update to be returned. Must be greater by one than the highest among the identifiers of previously received updates.
                                            -- By default, updates starting with the earliest unconfirmed update are returned.
                                            -- An update is considered confirmed as soon as getUpdates is called with an offset higher than its update_id.
                                            -- The negative offset can be specified to retrieve updates starting from -offset update from the end of the updates queue.
                                            -- All previous updates will forgotten.
  , getUpdates_limit           :: Maybe Int -- ^ Limits the number of updates to be retrieved. Values between 1—100 are accepted. Defaults to 100.
  , getUpdates_timeout         :: Maybe Int -- ^ Timeout in seconds for long polling. Defaults to 0, i.e. usual short polling. Should be positive, short polling should be used for testing purposes only.
